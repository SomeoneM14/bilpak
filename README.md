a python project that consists an app and a server, the app conects to the server and gives the user partial control over the computer the server is on.
i plan to remake the server in C or C# and remake the app as a website.
both app and server use python. app was made with kivy for python.
code is very messy so good luck.
(+ a lot of stuff isnt working)
